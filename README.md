Subset Sum: State Areas
------------------------

A dynamic programming approach to the problem of finding a subset of states whose ares add up to 47% of the total 
area of the United States finds that there is such a subset of states that solves the problem.

Creating a simple program to check the sum of the areas of these states, I found that the subset of states above 
does indeed sum to 47% of the total area of the United States, and therefore this subset satisfies the problem.

The specific subset of states that is obtained is:
{Florida, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Nebraska, Utah, Minnesota, Colorado, New Mexico, California, Texas, Alaska}
